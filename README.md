# advent-of-code-2021

My take at solving [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) in Clojure.

Notes:
1. My only goal is to solve the puzzles. I don't aim to write the fastest code or
the cleanest code. I just want something that works.
2. Day 15's puzzle just screams "Dijkstra's algorithm" but it's a pain to implement
in Clojure because of its persistent data structures. For that reason I decided to
solve that day's puzzle in Java.
